- abs: "Optimizing robotic action parameters is a significant challenge for manipulation tasks that demand high levels of precision and generalization. Using a model-based approach, the robot must quickly reason about the outcomes of different actions using a predictive model to find a set of parameters that will have the desired effect. The model may need to capture the behaviors of rigid and deformable objects, as well as objects of various shapes and sizes. Predictive models often need to trade-off speed for prediction accuracy and generalization. This paper proposes a framework that leverages the strengths of multiple predictive models, including analytical, learned, and simulation-based models, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of action parameter optimization. Our approach uses Model Deviation Estimators (MDEs) to determine the most suitable predictive model for any given state-action parameters, allowing the robot to select models to make fast and precise predictions. We extend the MDE framework by not only learning sim-to-real MDEs, but also sim-to-sim MDEs. Our experiments show that these sim-to-sim MDEs provide significantly faster parameter optimization as well as a basis for efficiently learning sim-to-real MDEs through finetuning. The ease of collecting sim-to-sim training data also allows the robot to learn MDEs based directly on visual inputs and local material properties."

- abs: "Dexterous robotic manipulation remains a challenging domain due to its strict demands for precision and robustness on both hardware and software. While dexterous robotic hands have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks, efficiently learning adaptive control policies for hands still presents a significant hurdle given the high dimensionalities of hands and tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose Tilde, an imitation learning-based in-hand manipulation system on a dexterous DeltaHand. It leverages 1) a low-cost, configurable, simple-to-control, soft dexterous robotic hand, DeltaHand, 2) a user-friendly, precise, real-time teleoperation interface, TeleHand, and 3) an efficient and generalizable imitation learning approach with diffusion policies. Our proposed TeleHand has a kinematic twin design to the DeltaHand that enables precise one-to-one joint control of the DeltaHand during teleoperation. This facilitates efficient high-quality data collection of human demonstrations in the real world. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we demonstrate the fully autonomous closed-loop deployment of diffusion policies learned from demonstrations across seven dexterous manipulation tasks with an average 90% success rate."

- abs: "Monitoring crop nutrients can aid farmers in optimizing fertilizer use. Many existing robots rely on vision-based phenotyping, however, which can only indirectly estimate nutrient deficiencies once crops have undergone visible color changes. We present a contact-based phenotyping robot platform that can directly insert nitrate sensors into cornstalks to proactively monitor macronutrient levels in crops. This task is challenging because inserting such sensors requires sub-centimeter precision in an environment which contains high levels of clutter, lighting variation, and occlusion. To address these challenges, we develop a robust perception-action pipeline to grasp stalks, and create a custom robot gripper which mechanically aligns the sensor before inserting it into the stalk. Through experimental validation on 48 unique stalks in a cornfield in Iowa, we demonstrate our platform's capability of detecting a stalk with 94 success"

- abs: "There is growing interest in automating agricultural tasks that require intricate and precise interaction with specialty crops, such as trees and vines. However, developing robotic solutions for crop manipulation remains a difficult challenge due to complexities involved in modeling their deformable behavior. In this study, we present a framework for learning the deformation behavior of tree-like crops under contact interaction. Our proposed method involves encoding the state of a spring-damper modeled tree crop as a graph. This representation allows us to employ graph networks to learn both a forward model for predicting resulting deformations, and a contact policy for inferring actions to manipulate tree crops. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments in a simulated environment and demonstrate generalizability of our method on previously unseen trees."

- abs: "Large, high-capacity models trained on diverse datasets have shown remarkable successes on efficiently tackling downstream applications. In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every environment. Can we instead train “generalist” X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation, alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data, which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by leveraging experience from other platforms."

- abs: "Dexterous robotic manipulation in unstructured environments can aid in everyday tasks such as cleaning and caretaking. Anthropomorphic robotic hands are highly dexterous and theoretically well-suited for working in human domains, but their complex designs and dynamics often make them difficult to control. By contrast, parallel-jaw grippers are easy to control and are used extensively in industrial applications, but they lack the dexterity for various kinds of grasps and in-hand manipulations. In this work, we present DELTAHANDS, a synergistic dexterous hand framework with Delta robots. The DELTAHANDS are soft, easy to reconfigure, simple to manufacture with low-cost off-the-shelf materials, and possess high degrees of freedom that can be easily controlled. DELTAHANDS' dexterity can be adjusted for different applications by leveraging actuation synergies, which can further reduce the control complexity, overall cost, and energy consumption. We characterize the Delta robots' kinematics accuracy, force profiles, and workspace range to assist with hand design. Finally, we evaluate the versatility of DELTAHANDS by grasping a diverse set of objects and by using teleoperation to complete three dexterous manipulation tasks: cloth folding, cap opening, and cable arrangement."

- abs: "For robotics systems to be used in high risk, real-world situations, they have to be quickly deployable and robust to environmental changes, under-performing hardware, and mission subtask failures. Robots are often designed to consider a single sequence of mission events, with complex algorithms lowering individual subtask failure rates under some critical con- straints. Our approach is to leverage common techniques in vision and control and encode robustness into mission structure through outcome monitoring and recovery strategies, aided by a system infrastructure that allows for quick mission deployments under tight time con- straints and no central communication. We also detail lessons in rapid field robotics devel- opment and testing. Systems were developed and evaluated through real-robot experiments at an outdoor test site in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA, as well as in the 2020 Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge. All competition trials were completed in fully autonomous mode without RTK-GPS. Our system led to 4th place in Challenge 2 and 7th place in the Grand Challenge, and achievements like popping five balloons (Challenge 1), successfully picking and placing a block (Challenge 2), and dispensing the most water autonomously with a UAV of all teams onto an outdoor, real fire (Challenge 3)."

- abs: "Multimodal information such as tactile, proximity and force sensing is essential for performing stable contact-rich manipulations. However, coupling multimodal information and motion control still remains a challenging topic. Rather than learning a monolithic skill policy that takes in all feedback signals at all times, skills should be divided into phases and learn to only use the sensor signals applicable to that phase. This makes learning the primitive policies for each phase easier, and allows the primitive policies to be more easily reused among different skills. However, stopping and abruptly switching between each primitive policy results in longer execution times and less robust behaviours. We therefore propose a blending approach to seamlessly combining the primitive policies into a reliable combined control policy. We evaluate both time-based and state-based blending approaches. The resulting approach was successfully evaluated in simulation and on a real robot, with an augmented finger vision sensor, on: opening a cap, turning a dial and flipping a breaker tasks. The evaluations show that the blended policies with multimodal feedback can be easily learned and reliably executed."

The last decade has seen substantial growth in research on the problem of robot manipulation, which aims to exploit the increasing availability of affordable robot arms and grippers to create robots capable of directly interacting with the world to achieve their goals. Learning will be central to such autonomous systems, as the real world contains too much variation for a robot to expect to have an accurate model of its environment, the objects in it, or the skills required to manipulate them, in advance. We aim to survey a representative subset of that research which uses machine learning for manipulation. We describe a formalization of the robot manipulation learning problem that synthesizes existing research into a single coherent framework and highlight the many remaining research opportunities and challenges."

- abs: "Tactile sensing is a key sensor modality for robots interacting with their surroundings. These sensors provide a rich and diverse set of data signals that contain detailed information collected from contacts between the robot and its environment. The data is however not limited to individual contacts and can be used to extract a wide range of information about the objects in the environment as well as the actions of the robot during the interactions. In this paper, we provide an overview of tactile information and its applications in robotics. We present a hierarchy consisting of raw, contact, object, and action levels to structure the tactile information, with higher-level information often building upon lower-level information. We discuss different types of information that can be extracted at each level of the hierarchy. The paper also includes an overview of different types of robot applications and the types of tactile information that they employ. Finally we end the article with a discussion for future tactile applications which are still beyond the current capabilities of robots."

- abs: "Soft tactile skins can provide an in-depth understanding of contact location and force through a soft and deformable interface. However, widespread implementation of soft robotic sensing skins remains limited due to non-scalable fabrication techniques, lack of customization, and complex integration requirements. In this work, we demonstrate magnetic composites fabricated with two different matrix materials, a silicone elastomer and urethane foam, that can be used as continuous tactile surfaces for single-point contact localization. Building upon previous work, we increased the sensing area from a 15 mm^2 grid to a 40 mm^2 continuous surface. Additionally, new preprocessing methods for the raw magnetic field data, in conjunction with the use of a neural network, enables rapid location and force estimation in free space. We report an average localization of 1 mm^3 for the silicone surface and 2 mm^3 for the urethane foam. Our approach to soft sensing skins addresses the need for tactile soft surfaces that are simple to fabricate and integrate, customizable in shape and material, and usable in both soft and hybrid robotic systems."

To improve grasping performance on such objects, we introduce a method for learning a multi-modal perception model by bootstrapping from an existing uni-modal model. This transfer learning approach requires only a pre-existing uni-modal grasping model and paired multi-modal image data for training, foregoing the need for ground-truth grasp success labels nor real grasp attempts. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to reliably grasp transparent and reflective objects."

The data is then used to train a Grasp Quality Network (GQN) that predicts the outcome of grasps from visual information. A grasp optimization pipeline uses homography models with the trained network to optimize the grasp success rate. We evaluate and compare several algorithms for adjusting the current gripper pose based on the current observation from a gripper-mounted camera to perform visual servoing. Evaluations in both simulated and hardware environments show considerable improvement in grasp robustness with models trained using less than 30K grasp trials. Success rates for grasping novel objects unseen during training increased from 18.5% to 81.0% in simulation, and from 17.8% to 78.0% in the real world."

- abs: "Tactile sensors have been increasingly used to support rigid robot grippers in object grasping and manipulation. However, rigid grippers are often limited in their ability to handle compliant, delicate, or irregularly shaped objects. In recent years, grippers made from soft and flexible materials have become increasingly popular for certain manipulation tasks, e.g., grasping, due to their ability to conform to the object shape without the need for precise control. Although promising, such soft robot grippers currently suffer from the lack of available sensing modalities. In this work, we introduce a soft and stretchable sensing skin and incorporate it into the two fingers of a shape-memory actuated soft gripper. The on-board sensing skin includes a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) and five discrete pressure sensors per finger. We use this sensorized soft gripper to study grasp success and stability of over 2585 grasps with various objects using several machine learning methods. Our experiments show that LSTMs were the most accurate predictors of grasp success and stability, compared to SVMs, FFNNs, and ST-HMP. We also evaluated the effects on performance of each sensor’s data, and the success rates for individual objects. The results show that the accelerometer data of the IMUs has the largest contribution to the overall grasp prediction, which we attribute to its ability to detect precise movements of the gripper during grasping."

- abs: "We cast visual imitation as a visual correspondence problem. Our robotic agent is rewarded when its actions result in better matching of relative spatial configurations for corresponding visual entities detected in its workspace and the teacher’s demonstration. We build upon recent advances in Computer Vision, such as human finger keypoint detectors, object detectors trained on-the- fly with synthetic augmentations, and point detectors supervised by viewpoint changes and learn multiple visual entity detectors for each demonstration with- out human annotations or robot interactions. We empirically show that the pro- posed factorized visual representations of entities and their spatial arrangements drive successful imitation of a variety of manipulation skills within minutes, us- ing a single demonstration and without any environment instrumentation. It is robust to background clutter and can effectively generalize across environment variations between demonstrator and imitator, greatly outperforming unstructured non-factorized full-frame CNN encodings of previous works."

- abs: "Cutting is a common form of manipulation when working with divisible objects such as food, rope, or clay. Cooking in particular relies heavily on cutting to divide food items into desired shapes. However, cutting food is a challenging task due to the wide range of material properties exhibited by food items. Due to this variability, the same cutting motions cannot be used for all food items. Sensations from contact events, e.g., when placing the knife on the food item, will also vary depending on the material properties, and the robot will need to adapt accordingly. In this paper, we propose using vibrations and force-torque feedback from the interactions to adapt the slicing motions and monitor for contact events. The robot learns neural networks for performing each of these tasks and generalizing across different material properties. By adapting and monitoring the skill executions, the robot is able to reliably cut through more than 20 different types of food items and even detect whether certain food items are fresh or old."

- abs: "Precise robotic grasping is important for many industrial applications, such as assembly and palletizing, where the location of the object needs to be controlled and known. However, achieving precise grasps is challenging due to noise in sensing and control, as well as unknown object properties. We propose a method to plan robotic grasps that are both robust and precise by training two convolutional neural networks - one to predict the robustness of a grasp and another to predict a distribution of post-grasp object displacements. Our networks are trained with depth images in simulation on a dataset of over 1000 industrial parts and were successfully deployed on a real robot without having to be further fine-tuned. The proposed displacement estimator achieves a mean prediction errors of 0.68cm and 3.42deg on novel objects in real world experiments."

- abs: "Recent progress in soft‐matter sensors has shown improved fabrication techniques, resolution, and range. However, scaling up these sensors into an information‐rich tactile skin remains largely limited by designs that require a corresponding increase in the number of wires to support each new sensing node. To address this, a soft tactile skin that can estimate force and localize contact over a continuous 15 mm2 area with a single integrated circuit and four output wires is introduced. The skin is composed of silicone elastomer loaded with randomly distributed magnetic microparticles. Upon deformation, the magnetic particles change position and orientation with respect to an embedded magnetometer, resulting in a change in the net measured magnetic field. Two experiments are reported to calibrate and estimate both location and force of surface contact. The classification algorithms can localize pressure with an accuracy of >98% on both grid and circle pattern. Regression algorithms can localize pressure to a 3 mm2 area on average. This proof‐of‐concept sensing skin addresses the increasing need for a simple‐to‐fabricate, quick‐to‐integrate, and information‐rich tactile surface for use in robotic manipulation, soft systems, and biomonitoring."

- abs: "Robots are prone to making mistakes when performing manipulation tasks in unstructured environments. Robust policies are thus needed to not only avoid mistakes but also to recover from them. We propose a framework for increasing the robustness of contact-based manipulations by modeling the task structure and optimizing a policy for selecting skills and recovery skills. A multimodal state transition model is acquired based on the contact dynamics of the task and the observed transitions. A policy is then learned from the model using reinforcement learning. The policy is incrementally improved by expanding the action space by generating recovery skills with a heuristic. Evaluations on three simulated manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. The robot was able to complete the tasks despite multiple contact state changes and errors encountered, increasing the success rate averaged across the tasks from 70.0% to 95.3%."

- abs: "In this work, we present an interaction-based approach to learn semantically rich representations for the task of slicing vegetables. Unlike previous approaches, we focus on object-centric representations and use auxiliary tasks to learn rich representations using a two-step process. First, we use simple auxiliary tasks, such as predicting the thickness of a cut slice, to learn an embedding space which captures object properties that are important for the task of slicing vegetables. In the second step, we use these learned latent embeddings to learn a forward model. Learning a forward model affords us to plan online in the latent embedding space and forces our model to improve its representations while performing the slicing task. To show the efficacy of our approach we perform experiments on two different vegetables: cucumbers and tomatoes. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method is able to capture important semantic properties for the slicing task, such as the thickness of the vegetable being cut. We further show that by using our learned forward model, we can plan for the task of vegetable slicing."

- abs: "Granular materials produce audio-frequency mechanical vibrations in air and structures when manipulated. These vibrations correlate with both the nature of the events and the intrinsic properties of the materials producing them. We therefore propose learning to use audio-frequency vibrations from contact events to estimate the flow and amount of granular materials during scooping and pouring tasks. We evaluated multiple deep and shallow learning frameworks on a dataset of 13,750 shaking and pouring samples across five different granular materials. Our results indicate that audio is an informative sensor modality for accurately estimating flow and amounts, with a mean RMSE of 2.8 g across the five materials for pouring. We also demonstrate how the learned networks can be used to pour a desired amount of material."
