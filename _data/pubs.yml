- abs: "Optimizing robotic action parameters is a significant challenge for manipulation tasks that demand high levels of precision and generalization. Using a model-based approach, the robot must quickly reason about the outcomes of different actions using a predictive model to find a set of parameters that will have the desired effect. The model may need to capture the behaviors of rigid and deformable objects, as well as objects of various shapes and sizes. Predictive models often need to trade-off speed for prediction accuracy and generalization. This paper proposes a framework that leverages the strengths of multiple predictive models, including analytical, learned, and simulation-based models, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of action parameter optimization. Our approach uses Model Deviation Estimators (MDEs) to determine the most suitable predictive model for any given state-action parameters, allowing the robot to select models to make fast and precise predictions. We extend the MDE framework by not only learning sim-to-real MDEs, but also sim-to-sim MDEs. Our experiments show that these sim-to-sim MDEs provide significantly faster parameter optimization as well as a basis for efficiently learning sim-to-real MDEs through finetuning. The ease of collecting sim-to-sim training data also allows the robot to learn MDEs based directly on visual inputs and local material properties."

- abs: "Dexterous robotic manipulation remains a challenging domain due to its strict demands for precision and robustness on both hardware and software. While dexterous robotic hands have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks, efficiently learning adaptive control policies for hands still presents a significant hurdle given the high dimensionalities of hands and tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose Tilde, an imitation learning-based in-hand manipulation system on a dexterous DeltaHand. It leverages 1) a low-cost, configurable, simple-to-control, soft dexterous robotic hand, DeltaHand, 2) a user-friendly, precise, real-time teleoperation interface, TeleHand, and 3) an efficient and generalizable imitation learning approach with diffusion policies. Our proposed TeleHand has a kinematic twin design to the DeltaHand that enables precise one-to-one joint control of the DeltaHand during teleoperation. This facilitates efficient high-quality data collection of human demonstrations in the real world. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we demonstrate the fully autonomous closed-loop deployment of diffusion policies learned from demonstrations across seven dexterous manipulation tasks with an average 90% success rate."

- abs: "Monitoring crop nutrients can aid farmers in optimizing fertilizer use. Many existing robots rely on vision-based phenotyping, however, which can only indirectly estimate nutrient deficiencies once crops have undergone visible color changes. We present a contact-based phenotyping robot platform that can directly insert nitrate sensors into cornstalks to proactively monitor macronutrient levels in crops. This task is challenging because inserting such sensors requires sub-centimeter precision in an environment which contains high levels of clutter, lighting variation, and occlusion. To address these challenges, we develop a robust perception-action pipeline to grasp stalks, and create a custom robot gripper which mechanically aligns the sensor before inserting it into the stalk. Through experimental validation on 48 unique stalks in a cornfield in Iowa, we demonstrate our platform's capability of detecting a stalk with 94 success"

- abs: "There is growing interest in automating agricultural tasks that require intricate and precise interaction with specialty crops, such as trees and vines. However, developing robotic solutions for crop manipulation remains a difficult challenge due to complexities involved in modeling their deformable behavior. In this study, we present a framework for learning the deformation behavior of tree-like crops under contact interaction. Our proposed method involves encoding the state of a spring-damper modeled tree crop as a graph. This representation allows us to employ graph networks to learn both a forward model for predicting resulting deformations, and a contact policy for inferring actions to manipulate tree crops. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments in a simulated environment and demonstrate generalizability of our method on previously unseen trees."

- abs: "Large, high-capacity models trained on diverse datasets have shown remarkable successes on efficiently tackling downstream applications. In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every environment. Can we instead train “generalist” X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation, alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data, which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by leveraging experience from other platforms."

- abs: "Dexterous robotic manipulation in unstructured environments can aid in everyday tasks such as cleaning and caretaking. Anthropomorphic robotic hands are highly dexterous and theoretically well-suited for working in human domains, but their complex designs and dynamics often make them difficult to control. By contrast, parallel-jaw grippers are easy to control and are used extensively in industrial applications, but they lack the dexterity for various kinds of grasps and in-hand manipulations. In this work, we present DELTAHANDS, a synergistic dexterous hand framework with Delta robots. The DELTAHANDS are soft, easy to reconfigure, simple to manufacture with low-cost off-the-shelf materials, and possess high degrees of freedom that can be easily controlled. DELTAHANDS' dexterity can be adjusted for different applications by leveraging actuation synergies, which can further reduce the control complexity, overall cost, and energy consumption. We characterize the Delta robots' kinematics accuracy, force profiles, and workspace range to assist with hand design. Finally, we evaluate the versatility of DELTAHANDS by grasping a diverse set of objects and by using teleoperation to complete three dexterous manipulation tasks: cloth folding, cap opening, and cable arrangement."

- abs: "Recent progress in soft‐matter sensors has shown improved fabrication techniques, resolution, and range. However, scaling up these sensors into an information‐rich tactile skin remains largely limited by designs that require a corresponding increase in the number of wires to support each new sensing node. To address this, a soft tactile skin that can estimate force and localize contact over a continuous 15 mm2 area with a single integrated circuit and four output wires is introduced. The skin is composed of silicone elastomer loaded with randomly distributed magnetic microparticles. Upon deformation, the magnetic particles change position and orientation with respect to an embedded magnetometer, resulting in a change in the net measured magnetic field. Two experiments are reported to calibrate and estimate both location and force of surface contact. The classification algorithms can localize pressure with an accuracy of >98% on both grid and circle pattern. Regression algorithms can localize pressure to a 3 mm2 area on average. This proof‐of‐concept sensing skin addresses the increasing need for a simple‐to‐fabricate, quick‐to‐integrate, and information‐rich tactile surface for use in robotic manipulation, soft systems, and biomonitoring."
